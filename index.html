		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>
		I'm Jona, a second year computer science student at the University of California, Irvine.
		I like programming, math, music, and anything tech.
		The summer after high school, I got into game development with Unity.
		I studied C# from Jamie King's C# tutorials on YouTube as the same time I picked up Unity,
		and I used those skills to prototype a dungeon crawler the summer after that. It was an amazing experience!
		
		<br><br>
		
		I also recently developed an interest in music composition and sound design.
		I am currently working on developing a virtual reality DAW in a research project.
		
		<br><br>
		
		Finally, I recently became interested in web development.
		I am amazed at the power of websites because they have the power to influence many people at once.
		With just a spark of inspiration, someone with web development skills could provide a vaulable service to
		anyone browsing the web.
		
		<br><br>
		
		My experience at UC Irvine has been great so far.
		I'm looking forward to learning a lot about current technologies and applying my knowledge to doing something awesome.
		In the meantime, I'll continue building this website and making it look more elegant.

				<p>
				Trying to create a tool to easily create dialogue nodes.
				If the HTML DOM objects (nodes) could be serialized as JSON, there could be a script
				that parses the JSON and creates Scriptable Objects in Unity.
				<br>
				Then I could add a lot of dialogue to my game with branches, loops, and events easily.
