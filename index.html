		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>
		I'm Jona, a second year computer science student at the University of California, Irvine (UCI).
		I like programming, math, music, and anything tech.
		
		<br><br>
		
		The summer after high school, I got into game development with Unity.
		I studied C# from Jamie King's C# tutorials on YouTube as the same time I picked up Unity,
		and I used those skills to prototype a dungeon crawler. It was an amazing experience!
		
		<br><br>
		
		I also recently developed an interest in music composition and sound design.
		I am currently building a virtual reality DAW in a research project.
		
		<br><br>
		
		I'm also picking up some web development skills. Making websites is fun and interesting.
		I'm looking forward to acquiring full-stack skills and coding up some fun/useful websites!
		
		<br><br>
		
		My experience at UCI has been great so far.
		I'm looking forward to learning a lot about current technologies and applying my knowledge to doing something awesome.
		In the meantime, I'll continue building this website and improving its appearance.

		<h2>My Work</h2>

		<ul>
			<li>
				<h3>Dungeon RPG Prototype</h3>
				<p>
					Inspired by dungeon crawler titles such as the Etrian Odyssey series, I set off to build my own
					<a href="#dungeon_crawler">dungeon crawler</a>.
					
					<br><br>
					
					Making a game is an astonishing amount of work!
					Coding the various systems (dialogue, dungeon, traps, menus, towns, states, quests)
					has taught me a lot about good program design.
					I thoroughly enjoy the challenge.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>Tile Editor</h3>
				<p>
				I've always wanted to create my own virtual worlds to explore.
				One tool that could help tremendously with world-building is a tile editor.
				A tile editor allows a level designer to sketch out levels quickly with an intuitive UI.
				Below is my (unfinished) tile editor created for my dungeon crawler.
				Currently, you can paint the ground tiles of a level,
				press "Save," and load the level (serialized as JSON) into the dungeon scene. Pretty neat!

			<li>
				<h3>Dialogue node editor</h3>
				<a href="dialogue_node_editor.html">[Work in progress] Dialogue node editor</a>
				<p>
				Trying to create a tool to easily create dialogue nodes.
				If the HTML DOM objects (nodes) could be serialized as JSON, there could be a script
				that parses the JSON and creates Scriptable Objects in Unity.
				<br>
				Then I could add a lot of dialogue to my game with branches, loops, and events easily.
